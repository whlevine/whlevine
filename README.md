- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @whlevine. That's not a picture of me. It's my beloved cat Quigley, who was my roommate and close companion for many years.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in language processing, particularly reading, and especially fiction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on writing a graduate-level statistics textbook to use in the psychology grad-stats class I teach. If I can figure out how to host it here on Github, I will! If not, it'll be hosted at bookdown.org.
- ðŸ“« Email is by far the best way to reach me. My professional email is whlevine@uark.edu. My personal email is whlevine@gmail.com. I check them both regularly. I'm also active on Twitter, though it's rare that I contribute original content.
